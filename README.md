#Project One
####Project one is a sample project meant for practice as I learn to utilize github for version control and collaboration. 

In this branch you'll find the following pages:
*index.html
*about-us.html
*contact-us.html
*blog.html
	*achive
	*resent

The project is a rather simple one and can be replicated by anyone who wishes to learn to use github.

####Another rather important subject I learnt in the process of learning to use github is markdown.
####So far I have been able to utilize some of these knowledge in writing this document.
